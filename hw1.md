### Part 1
**Watch these videos:**

* *What is Open Source?*
* *Open Source vs. Closed Source Software*
* *Open Source Basics | Intel Software*

Answer the following question:

**1. What are the advantages of open source?**
* The advantages of an open source software is the ability to modify applications,improve or customize them. With open source comes better security and no vendor lock in.
  
**2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?**
* The basic freedoms that make a software open source is the freedom to run the program as you wish, to study how the program works and change it. The freedom to copy and share along with sharing improvements of your modified version to others. 
  
**3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?**
* I think people should use the free software/open-source alternative because it's usually free and you will have access to the source code and be able to modify it. Another reason is public collaboration can find bugs, add features, and improve performance. 
  
**4. Watch the following video: Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree Explain your answer.**
* Yes, I agree on Richard Stallman's stance on why free software is important because computer users should have control over their computing. As he stated "..a proprietary program is an instrument of unjust power from one entity over whoever is foolish enough to use it." As he mentioned, freedom means free software which includes the four essentials freedoms. I agree that a user should control the program and not the program that controls the user. You deserve to run a program as you wish, study the source code and change the code as you wish, redistribute copies, and redistribute modified versions.

### Part 2
