## Homework 3 Finding a Linux Distributions to Solve Specific Problems.

Given the scenario, use the internet or go straight to Distrowatch to find a Linux distribution that will fit best. You need to explain your answers in at least 1 paragraph. (4 to 8 sentences). For each distribution provide the following information:

* What is it based on? (Debian, Slackware, Redhat, Arch, etc)
* URL to where it can be downloaded from.
* The Supported processor architecture (x86, x86_64, arm, etc)

## Scenario 1: Using a Live Linux Installation
John is fixing Mario’s laptop. He needs to prepare a live USB flash drive that he can boot Linux from so that he can access some important information. The problem is that he only has a 4GB flash drive available. Which Linux distribution would you advise John to use to prepare the live USB installation?

![Puppy Linux](../images/../cis106/images/Puppylinux.png) |  Independent | https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=puppy |i686, x86_64
* I would advise John to use the linux distribution **Puppy Linux** for his live usb installation because of it's small size and ease of use. It is customizable, supports old computers, and there is a variety of Puppy Linux to fit your needs. You can rescue files from the users PC hosed hard drive or perform maintenance tasks. Puppy Linux is designed to run into ram and is incredibly fast. 
  
## Scenario 2: Using Linux for parental control
Mario is concerned about his children using the house computer. He has an older laptop that he has not used in a while and has hired you to prepare that laptop for his children to use. Mario wants the children to use the computer mostly for educational purposes so he asks you to install educational tools in it. He is also concerned about his children using the internet so asks you if you could somehow install a web browser/search engine that has parental control or at least blocks adult content. Mario has given you $150 dollars for upgrades so that if needed you can proceed without contacting him. Which Linux distribution would install in Mario’s older laptop?

![primtux](../images/../cis106/images/primtux.png) | Ubuntu, Debian (stable)| https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=primtux | armhf, i686, x86_64

* The linux distribution that would install on Mario's older laptop is called **PrimTux**. This distribution was developed by school teachers and IT enthusiants to use on old computers for educational purposes. It offers a educational software for children from kindergarten to college. It comes with a parental control called Webstrict that will allow you to block or restrict access from the internet.

## Scenario 3: Linux + Gaming
Johanna is a gamer. She loves playing RPGs and Indie games. Johanna makes a living streaming her gaming sessions on Twitch and YouTube. She is angry because, during one of her live streams, windows 10 decided to install an update. All of Johanna’s games are available for Linux and she is good enough with computers to be able to pick up using a new operating system. Which Linux distribution would you recommend Johanna to try?

![steamos](../images/../cis106/images/steamos.jpg) | Debian (stable) | https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=steamos | x86_64

* I would recommend Johanna to try the linux distribution called **SteamOS**. SteamOS is an open source OS that is based on Debian and optimizes for a nice living room experience. It is the primary OS for the Steam Machine gaming platform by Valve. SteamOS installs a Valve proprietary version of Wine and allows installing and playing Windows games.

## Scenario 4: Reviving an old PC
Giorgina has an old computer that came with Windows Vista. She cannot afford to buy a new computer or update her current PC. Her computer is used for online shopping, reading emails, paying her bills, and listening to music. All her music is on an external hard drive and she normally does not keep important information on her computer. Georgina is willing to pay you to make her computer faster. You have concluded that installing Linux is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to help her. However, in such an old PC, Ubuntu 20.04 will be almost as slow as Windows 10 so you need to find another distribution that is much lighter on system resources and has been designed for running on older hardware. Which distribution will you install in Georgina’s dinosaur PC?

![lxle](../images/../cis106/images/lxle.png)| Debian, Lubuntu | https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=lxle | i686, x86_64 

*I would install the linux distribution called **Lxle** on Georgina's dinosaur PC. Lxle has pretty low system requirements which helps it bring old computers to life. It is a lightweight easy to use desktop that covers most users everyday needs. It's a fully featured OS that adds useful modifications, tweaks to improve performance/functions, and has several design changes.
